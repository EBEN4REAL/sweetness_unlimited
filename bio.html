							<p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me.

							<p>Becoming a gynaecologist was Abigail’s childhood dream, not out of passion for medicine but because she thought parents determine their children’s future career since her father was fond of saying;
								“Adeola is very brilliant; she will grow up to be a medical doctor”
								In a recent interview, Abigail said;
								“My plan was to start following Daddy to the hospital after my SSCE (before I gain admission into the University to learn some basic elements of medicine from him, but unfortunately, death played a fast one on us by snatching him away on my first day in SS3.”

							<p>At Sixteen, She was a scriptwriter for late veteran Broadcaster Ayo Omotosho on his radio programme LOVE ZONE. Long before then in primary school, Abigail wrote her first playlets (which she made into small booklets with sheets of papers bound with broomsticks) for her friends to read. She composed her first song at six
								“Ice water o

								 Gbogbo School in community o
								 Ice water”

							<p>“I’ll be doing more of the afro-soul and afro-pop genre. As you know, my first single, ELDORADO, is a kind of song that gladdens the heart and make you shake your body; that’s exactly what I like to see people do.”</p>
